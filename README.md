## UX
---
My goal in the design was to make information for accommodation and activities easily visible on the website. The website provides links at appropriate places to redirect the user to external websites where they can find further information about booking, hotels, activities, and transport.
I wanted to give a little touch of simple and seaside appearance to the website using colors such as blue, white and light orange.

I decide to make a responsive and interactive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this website. Using HTML5 and CSS to make it responsive and applying  the skills learned from the User-Centric Frontend module of 
Full Stack Web Developer course from Code Institute. This site uses Javascript to implement maps that show interactive markers for Isles & available accommodation options.

All content from the main page to the media on this website was inspired by my birthday present which was a trip to this isles I want the users to find the information easily and completely understandable way with all the links and interactions inside the website. Also, every text was being resumed to make them quick and easy reading with the purpose to not get the users being bored.

This site uses one HTML file with slight differences of design on each part to give the website a continuous appearance.

## Features

#### Current Features

* Isles - This is a space whereby a user can be introduced all the isles and where are located looking at a map. All the markers are clickable and it gives the user an interactive welcome when the user closes the modal the page go to the accommodation space.
* Accommodation - This is a space to find all the hotels and restaurants that are in each Isla, also provides the top 10 for each isle.
* Explore - This is a space on the website for the user to get info about some activities and transportation to go to the isles.
* Contact - This is a space with a form that users can use for getting in touch and solve any queries they have.

### Future Features

In the future I would like to add on this website 2 more things:

* Booking area - Allowing the user to make reservations to any hotel, restaurant or activity on the Isles without going to other websites and lost their time to make them.
* Email Send Message - Ensuring the user receives a message and an email to let the users know their email was successfully sent and they will receive an answer as soon as possible.

## Testing
---

I have been automatically testing my website while I was developing the project. I used the web developer tools regularly to ensure my website was responsive for mobile screen sizes and larger screen sizes. I used the device feature of dev tools for testing the website on all devices available.

I've checked my HTML and CSS structure were done in [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) for HTML,[JIGSAW W3C Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) for CSS and [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) to make sure there weren't any awkward error and the structure was being coded correctly. I checked this continuously through the process.

If there was an error on my page, I would first change what was wrong in the dev tools so I would be able to see a live update into my browser. Once I've found the issue I went back to Cloud9 at AWS and make the changes there. 

Even for I've been provided my GitHub pages link to a group of friends to test the website on mobile and desktop. I had users click on all the links on the page, and also click on all the markers into the maps to make sure the links and makers worked as desired. My friends were asked to enter information into the contact form and ensure they entered information into every field because the form fields were designed with the 'required' attribute.

### Bugs

During the process of this website, I found little bugs but nothing I couldn't fix. 

A good example of this is when I change the color of the navbar links the "Isles" it didn't hoover to white when you pass the mouse through it.
It was working as desired after I delete one class that was extra.


## Deployment
---
My website was created using Cloud9 on AWS and I created an external repository on GitHub and linked it there in a new repository. This lets me protect my work against any unexpected error such as delete something essential to keep the project working.

* I created a new environment in Cloud9.
* Created all my folders and files.
* Inside the bash terminal, entered 'git init'.
* Entered 'git add .' into the terminal.
* Entered 'git commit' into the terminal and created my initial commit.
* Linked my local git repository to a GitHub repository.
* Followed the below steps to deploy the site to GitHub pages.

To deploy this website to GitHub pages:
* Clicked the Milestone2 from my GitHub dashboard.
* Select 'Settings' from the menu bar.
* From the GitHub pages section, I chose 'master branch' from the dropdown menu.
* Once selected, I refreshed the page and a link was generated in the GitHub pages section to my website.

## Acknowledgments
---

I receive inspiration for this website when I was there as my birthday present and little holidays, I fell in love with the long sandy beaches and the clear blue water that St Mary's has on its coast. Also because when I tried to find information and activities to do around the islands on Google, I had to navigate through to many pages to find some information about these Isles such activities, places to visit, where to pick up a boat ticket for wildlife safaris, etc.
