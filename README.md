# Isles of Scilly
## Description
---
This website is for getting information about Isles of Scilly where the users can find some accomodations and activities to do on their holidays in this area of England.

I decide to make a responsive and interactive website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for this website. Using HTML5 and CSS to make it responsive and applying  the skills learnt from the User Centric Frontend module of 
Full Stack Web Developer course from Code Institute and using JavaScript to implement some maps and make them interactive with the information provided on the website.



[My Website](https://debbiepimpo.github.io/Milestone2/)


## UX
---
My goal in the design was to make information for the accomodation and activities redirecting for an extension of information and main websites to an external URL if the users wants to book in addvance or get more 
information about the hotels, activities to do or transport to go to any Isle of Scilly. 

I wanted to give a little touch of simple and seaside appearance to the website using colours such as blue, white and light orange.

All content from the main page to the media on this website were inspired by my birthday present which was a trip to this isles I want the users find the information easily and completly understandable way with all the links and interactions inside the website.Also every text was being resumed to make them quick and easy reading with the purpose to not get the users being bored.

This site use, one HTML file with slightly differences of design on each part to give the website a continuously appearance.

## Testing
---

I have been automatically testing my website while i was developing the project. I used the web developer tools regulary to ensure my website was responsive for mobile screen sizes and larger screen sizes. I used the device feature of dev tools for testing the website on all devices available.

I've checked my HTML and CSS structure were done in [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) for HTML,[JIGSAW W3C Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) for CSS and [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) to make sure there weren't any awkward error and the structure was being coded correctly. I checked this continuously through the process.

If there was an error on my page, I would first change what was wrong in the dev tools so I would be able to see a live update into my browser. Once I've found the issue I went back to Cloud9 at AWS and make the changes there. 

Even for I've being provided my GitHub pages link to a group of friends in order to test the website on mobile and desktop. I had users click on all the links on the page, and also click on all the markers into the maps to make sure the links and makers worked as desired. My friends were asked to enter information into the contact form and ensure they were enter information into every field, because the form fields were designed with the 'required' attribute.


## Deployment

My website was created using Cloud9 on AWS and I created an external repository on GitHub and linked it there in a new repository. This let me to protect my work against any unexpected error such as delete something essential for keep the project working.

## Media

The images are half from Google images and the other half I took with my phone on June 2019 on this islands.

## Aknowledgements
---

I receive inspiration for this website when I was there as my birthday present and little holidays, I felt in love with the long sand beaches and the clear blue water that St Mary's has on its coast. Also because when I tried to find information and activities to do around the islands on Google, I had to navigate through to many pages to find some information about this Isles such activities, places to visit, where to pic up a boat ticket for wild life safaris, etc.
